### Week 10: Complete Transaction Execution in Blocks 🔄 PLANNING

**What Will Be Built:**

#### Phase 1: Transaction Extraction from Blocks (PENDING)
- Extract actual transaction hashes from consensus proposals
- Map transaction hashes to fees from transaction pool
- Calculate per-transaction-type fee breakdown
- Build fee distribution by transaction type (transfer, ubi_claim, profit_declaration, etc.)

**Approach:**
- Modify ConsensusProposal to include transaction list (or reference)
- Parse transactions from block_data in consensus engine
- Use transaction fee field directly (not mempool estimation)
- Update BlockMetadata with real transaction count and actual fees

#### Phase 2: Transaction Validation Before Inclusion (PENDING)
- Implement full transaction validation before adding to block
- Check signatures for each transaction
- Validate inputs/outputs for UTXO consistency
- Enforce fee >= min_fee_per_byte
- Prevent double-spending

**Approach:**
- Add validate_transaction_for_block() method
- Integration with existing UTXO validation
- Reject invalid transactions from mempool
- Keep rejected txs in separate error tracking

#### Phase 3: Block Construction with Real Transactions (PENDING)
- Build blocks with actual selected transactions
- Execute transaction effects (state changes)
- Track execution results per transaction
- Handle partial block failures gracefully

**Approach:**
- Update block proposal construction
- Replace mempool stats with actual tx hashes
- Maintain execution context for each transaction
- Store execution results in block metadata

#### Phase 4: Integration Testing at Scale (PENDING)
- Test 1K transactions per block
- Validate fee extraction accuracy across transaction types
- Benchmark block construction time
- Test mempool eviction under high throughput
- Verify fee distribution calculations

**Test Coverage:**
- 1K transaction block construction (1 test)
- Per-type fee extraction validation (5 tests)
- Transaction execution under load (3 tests)
- Fee accuracy across different transaction mixes (3 tests)
- Performance benchmarks (2 tests)
- Total: 14 new tests

#### Phase 5: Fee Distribution Pipeline (PENDING)
- Integrate with FeeRouter for actual distribution
- Split fees: 45% UBI, 30% DAOs, 15% Emergency, 10% Dev
- Track fees per component
- Validate totals match block fees

**Approach:**
- Call fee_router.collect_fee(total_fees)
- Call fee_router.distribute(height, governance, tx_hash)
- Log distribution breakdown
- Validate mathematical precision (no rounding errors)

### Week 10 Deliverables

**Governance Framework:** 6-phase model (Primitives → Sunset → Separation → Fees → Fairness → Execution)
**Target Launch:** April 13, 2026 (12 weeks from January 20)
**Current Progress:** 8/12 weeks complete (67%)
  - Week 0-1: Foundation ✅
  - Week 2-6: Contracts ✅
  - Week 7: Fee Integration + Transaction Types ✅
  - Week 8: Performance Validation ⏳ (skipped for Week 9)
  - Week 9: Transaction Execution ✅
  - Week 10-12: Testnet & Production ⏳

**Key Principle:** If code doesn't match financial projections, code is wrong. Always validate against source document.
