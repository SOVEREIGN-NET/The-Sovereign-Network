- Anonymous transactions native

**DApp Ideas:**

#### A. **Private Voting Platform**
```
Use Case: Corporate governance, DAOs, elections
Unique Feature: Zero-knowledge proofs prove you voted without revealing your choice
Market: Every DAO, company, organization
Competition: LOW - most voting is transparent
```

**Revenue Model:**
- Charge per election/vote
- SaaS for DAOs
- Enterprise licenses

**Tech You Need:**
```javascript
// Already available in your node!
- ZK circuits for vote privacy
- Nullifier system (prevent double voting)
- Anonymous credentials
```

#### B. **Confidential DeFi**
```
Use Case: Private trading, anonymous loans
